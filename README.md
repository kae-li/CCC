# The Chinese Cookbook Constellation

## Project Overview
This digital humanities project traces the transformation of Chinese recipes across a century through network visualization. Using Shiu Wong Chan’s 1917 cookbook, ***The Chinese Cook Book***, as a historical anchor, the project maps how 24 of Chan’s recipes have been adapted by five influential modern culinary authors: [*The Woks of Life*](https://thewoksoflife.com/), [*Made with Lau*](https://www.madewithlau.com/), [*Omnivore’s Cookbook*](https://www.madewithlau.com/), [*What To Cook Today*](https://whattocooktoday.com/), and [*RasaMalaysia*](https://rasamalaysia.com/). Each recipe and its adaptations are represented as nodes in an interactive network, connected by directed edges that capture specific modifications—whether an ingredient was added, removed, or substituted. The resulting visualization, built in Cytoscape, reveals not only individual changes but also broader patterns of culinary adaptation, authorship, and cultural translation.

By encoding modification types with color and grouping recipes by author, the network allows users to visually explore the “genealogy” of dishes and observe how dietary preferences, ingredient availability, and culinary innovation have reshaped Chinese cooking in the diaspora. The project makes available both the processed dataset—112 recipes and 1,004 modification relationships—and the methodology used to construct the network, offering a reproducible model for studying recipe evolution and a tangible entry point into discussions of food, memory, and cultural change.
